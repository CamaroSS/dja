What's that
-----------

*dja is a bit of Django framework, namely its template engine, ported to PHP.*

The primary aim of the project is a full-featured and as close to the original code 
as possible port of Django's template engine, thus intoducing this pragmatic template 
system to PHP developers. 

Yet another goal of dja is to make a land for smooth transitions between frameworks 
in different programming languages, without a need for template rewrites. 
That is template designers would be grateful and happy too.


Requirements
------------

1. PHP 5.3
2. PHPUnit (to be able to run unit tests)


Cheers!

To all the guys from Django team. Without your code there won't be any dja.
You are great! So, thank you!


The tip
-------

If dja is not what you want, you might be interested in considering other choices, e.g.:

* h2o-php - http://www.h2o-template.org/
* twig - http://twig.sensiolabs.org/
