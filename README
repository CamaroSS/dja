**ALPHA stage project. Interfaces might be changed at any moment. Use with care.**


What's that
-----------

*Dja is a bit of Django framework, namely its template engine, ported to PHP.*

The primary aim of the project is a full-featured and as close to the original code 
as possible port of Django's template engine, thus introducing this pragmatic 
template system to PHP developers. 

Yet another goal of dja is to make a land for smooth transitions between frameworks 
in different programming languages, without a need for template rewrites.
And, yes, template designers would be grateful and happy too.


Requirements
------------

1. PHP 5.3
2. PHPUnit (to be able to run unit tests)


Templates syntax
----------------

Django documentation is a good start:

* Syntax overview - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/templates/
* Built-in tags and filters - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/templates/builtins/


Usage example
-------------
::

  require_once 'dja/dja.php';

  $template = new Template('My template. It counts {{ what }}: {% for item in items %}{{ item }} and {% endfor %}no more. That\'s all, folks!');
  $context = new Context(array('items' => range(1, 10), 'what'=>'cows'));
  echo $template->render($context);


Philosophy
----------

Dja is from Python pragmatic world, it won't bother some PHP rules. It is not 
as if it is an impolite guest - it tries to be respectful whereever it doesn't 
go in confront with dja's inner dja. It operates upon the `necessary 
and sufficient` principle. It is wilful, so you can leave anytime you feel 
you had enough. And that's just how dja goes.

Beware stranger: dja doesn't give a damn for your fancy patterns urge; dja 
doesn't like ugly namespace notations; dja spits on setters and getters;
dja is worse than the Jabberwocky.

So welcome, or goodby, stranger.


Cheers!

To all the guys from Django team. Without your code there won't be any dja.
You are great! Thank you!


The tip
-------

If dja is not what you want, you might be interested in considering other 
choices, e.g.:

* h2o-php - http://www.h2o-template.org/
* twig - http://twig.sensiolabs.org/
