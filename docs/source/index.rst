**Submit issues.** If you spotted something weird in application behavior and want to report it
you can always do that at https://github.com/idlesign/dja/issues.

**Write code.** If you are eager to participate in application development, fork it
at https://github.com/idlesign/dja, write your code, whether it should be a bugfix or optimization
implementation, and make a pull request right from the forked project page.

**Spread the word.** If you have some tips and tricks or any other words in mind that you think might
be of interest for the others â€” publish it.


The tip
-------

If dja is not what you want, you might be interested in considering other
choices, e.g.:

* h2o-php - http://www.h2o-template.org/
* twig - http://twig.sensiolabs.org/
