What's that
-----------

*Dja is a bit of Django framework, namely its template engine, ported to PHP.*

The primary aim of the project is a full-featured and as close to the original code
as possible port of Django's template engine, thus introducing this pragmatic
template system to PHP developers.

Yet another goal of dja is to make a land for smooth transitions between frameworks
in different programming languages, without a need for template rewrites.
And, yes, template designers would be grateful and happy too.


Philosophy
----------

Dja is from Python pragmatic world, it won't bother some PHP rules. It is not
as if it is an impolite guest - it tries to be respectful whereever it doesn't
go in confront with dja's inner dja. It operates upon the `necessary
and sufficient` principle. It is wilful, so you can leave anytime you feel
you had enough. And that's just how dja goes.

Beware stranger: dja doesn't give a damn for your fancy patterns urge; dja
doesn't like ugly namespace notations; dja spits on setters and getters;
dja is worse than the Jabberwocky.

So welcome, or goodby, stranger.
